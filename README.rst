Phabricator Extensions
----------------------

This repository is a collection of extensions for `Phabricator <http://phabricator.org/>`_, a tool
originally open sourced by Facebook for task management and code review.

Based on `disqus-arcanist <https://github.com/disqus/disqus-arcanist>`_ and `mailru-arcanist <https://github.com/pzinovkin/mailru-arcanist>`_.


Installing Arcanist
============================

You'll need write access to /usr/local::

    $ curl -L https://raw.github.com/dreadatour/mailru-arcanist/master/getarcanist.sh | sh

This will give you access to the following additional commands:

**update-arcanist**

This executes the same script which you used to originally install Arcanist.
